      "Yes, many other Azure AI services support **Customer Managed Keys (CMK)** to help organizations maintain control over their data by managing encryption keys. This feature is part of Microsoft’s effort to ensure security and compliance for data-sensitive workloads. Below are examples of Azure AI services that support customer-managed keys:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Azure Cognitive Search**\n",
      "   - Azure Cognitive Search allows you to use customer-managed keys for encrypting your data at rest. This lets you maintain full control over the encryption keys stored in Azure Key Vault or Azure Managed HSM.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Azure Machine Learning**\n",
      "   - Azure Machine Learning supports customer-managed keys for encrypting both the **workspace's default storage account** and **data in Azure Machine Learning resources**, including datasets, models, and experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Azure Cognitive Services**\n",
      "   - Many Cognitive Services (e.g., Text Analytics, Translator, and Form Recognizer) allow customers to use CMK to encrypt customer data at rest by integrating with Azure Key Vault.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Azure Synapse Analytics with AI Integration**\n",
      "   - For AI workloads that run through Azure Synapse Analytics, CMK can be used to encrypt the associated data stored in services like Azure Data Lake or Synapse storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features of Customer-Managed Keys:\n",
      "   - Full control over the key lifecycle, including rotation, revocation, and expiration.\n",
      "   - Integration with Azure Key Vault or Azure Managed HSM for key storage and management.\n",
      "   - Enhanced compliance for industry-specific requirements, including GDPR, HIPAA, or financial regulations.\n",
      "   \n",
      "While support for CMK may vary slightly based on specific services or regions, Azure’s goal is to consistently provide this capability across its portfolio to address enterprise-grade security and compliance needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using or considering a specific Azure AI service, consult its documentation or feature overview to confirm CMK support and implementation details.\n"
